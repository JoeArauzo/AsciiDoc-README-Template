== Purpose
This template is offered to help create new repositories and kickstart your documentation process. It includes boilerplate text for a well-structured README. As a convenience, it also includes a placeholder README for what visitors to your repository will see while work is still in progess. See the placeholder screenshot below.

Why? Why another README template when so many README templates already exist? *This README is written in AsciiDoc markup*, _instead of Markdown_.  The syntax is https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/asciidoc-vs-markdown/[very similar to markdown] and easy to learn. Documents written in AsciiDoc markup are more easily converted to HTML5, PDF, EPUB, and other formats.

Asciidoc is a more powerful markup language designed for more complex content. Asciidoc uses a more extensive syntax than Markdown, allowing you to create more advanced formatting elements such as tables, footnotes, and cross-references. All without the headaches of inconsistent implementations frequently found with Markdown. For writing high-quality documentation, it just works.

AsciiDoc is simply plain-text.  You can author documents in your favorite text editor of choice, such as https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] with a proper https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[extension], or any derivative of https://www.vim.org/[VIM] (https://github.com/neovim/neovim#readme[Neovim], https://github.com/qvacua/vimr#readme[VimR]).  If you're just getting started with AsciiDoc, you may want to try https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX], until the markup syntax becomes second nature to you. The choice is yours.

[source,console]
----
sudo dnf install gh
----

*You may now proceed to _<<Clone This Repository>>_.*


=== Clone This Repository
This repository is available on GitHub as a template repository. As a convenience, the branches within this repository include a _boilerplate_ README, as well as a _placeholder_ README.  To ensure your repository includes these branches, you'll need to create your repository using the GitHub CLI. The following procedure will clone and create a local copy of this repository.

. *Launch your terminal.*

. *Change Working Directory:*
Change your working directory to the location where you want to create the local repository. Use the `cd` command and replace `WORKING_DIRECTORY` with the path to the directory of your choice:
+
[source,console]
----
cd WORKING_DIRECTORY
----

. *Authenticate with GitHub:*
If you haven't already authenticated with GitHub CLI, run the following command and follow the prompts:
+
[source,console]
----
gh auth login
----

. *Create a Local Clone from a Template Repository:*
Use the `gh rep create` command with the `--template` option to create a clone of a template repository. Use the `--clone` option to create a local clone. Use the `--public` option to make the new repostory public, or use the `--internal` or `--private` options instead. Use the `--include-all-branches` option to include all branches from the template repository. Replace `NEW_REPO_NAME` with a name of your choice. Replace `TEMPLATE_OWNER` with the template repository owner's username or organization, and `TEMPLATE_REPO` with the template repository name:
+
[source,console]
----
gh repo create --clone --public --include-all-branches MY_NEW_REPO --template TEMPLATE_OWNER/TEMPLATE_REPO
----
For example:
+
[source,console]
----
gh repo create --clone --public --include-all-branches my-new-repo --template JoeArauzo/AsciiDoc-README-Template
----
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,console]
----
Created repository YOUR_USERNAME/my-new-repo on GitHub
Cloning into 'my-new-repo'
----

. Navigate to the Local Repository:
Change your working directory to the newly created local repository:
+
[source,console]
----
cd NEW_REPO_NAME
----


== Usage
The following instructions are provided as a way to get started with setting up your new repository.

[NOTE]
This assumes git is already installed and configured on your system.

=== Create a Branch For Your README
Your new repository includes the boilerplate text you're reading here. Create a branch so you can use this text as a starting point for authoring your own README.

. *Create a Branch:*
Continuing from your local repository, use the `git checkout` command with the `-b` option to create and switch to the new branch in one step. Replace `NEW_BRANCH_NAME` with the name of your choice:
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME
----
For example:
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout -b docs/readme-draft
----

. *Push the New Branch to Remote:*
Push the new branch to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub), using the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
git push origin docs/readme-draft
----

Now you can proceed to personalize this README for your own needs. Additional instructions will be provided below to get your personalized README to show up on GitHub. Unitl ready, a placeholder README can be used.


=== Use a Placeholder README
A placeholder README can be displayed on GitHub until your README is ready. The use of a placholder is a good practice, by providing visitors with a hint of what's in store. This template includes a branch with a placholder you can modify for your own needs.

. *Switch to the Placholder README branch:*
Use the `git checkout` command to switch to the branch with the placholder README.
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout docs/readme-placeholder
----

. *Modify the Placeholder README:*
Modify the placeholder README by editing the file and with your preferred metadata, title, description and optional link.
+

[TIP]
The example listed above is only a starting point for customizing the README. Take a close look at the lines within to ensure you replace all the placeholder values. For example, don't forget to modify the HTML code near the top of the README which is used when displaying on GitHub.

. *Commit Changes:*
You now have changes in the placeholder README that you need to commit before proceeding.
+
[source,console]
----
git add .
git commit -m "docs(readme): set placeholder"
----

. *Push the Placeholder Branch to Remote (Optional):*
If you want to push the changes just made to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub), use:
+
[source,console]
----
git push origin docs/readme-placeholder
----

. *Merge Placeholder into Main Branch:*
In order for the placeholder README to be displayed on GitHub, you need to merge the placeholder branch into the main branch. Use the `git checkout` command, followed by the `git merge` command with the `-s` option and the `ours` merge strategy, which automatically resolves conflicts.
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout main
git merge docs/readme-placeholder m 'docs(readme): merge branch docs/readme-placeholder' -s ours --allow-unrelated-histories
----

. *Push the Changes:*
Push the changes so they show up in GitHub.
+
[source,console]
----
git push
----
Your personalized README is now displayed on GitHub.


=== Publish Your README
After you've published the placeholder README on your GitHub repository, you'll likely work on personalizing your README on the `docs/readme-draft` branch. When ready, you must replace the placeholder README on the main branch. Follow these steps. 

. *Merge README Draft into Main Branch:*
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout main
git merge docs/readme-draft -m 'docs(readme): publish draft' --allow-unrelated-histories
git push
----
